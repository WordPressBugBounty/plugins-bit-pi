### üåê Webhook Integration
Bit Flows makes it easy to connect your WordPress site with external platforms using incoming and outgoing webhooks. Incoming webhooks allow you to trigger automation flows from other applications, while outgoing webhooks let you send processed data to third-party services. For example, when a form is submitted on your site, Bit Flows can process that data and send it to your CRM automatically. This seamless two-way communication ensures your tools stay in sync‚Äîno manual transfers are needed.

### üõ†Ô∏è Custom App Integration
When native integrations aren't available, Bit Flows lets you build your own custom app connection using API endpoints. You can define authentication, enter endpoint URLs, and set up the logic to interact with any external API. For instance, if you need to connect your site with a shipping provider, you can use their API to fetch tracking info, update order status, or automate delivery notifications‚Äîall directly through Bit Flows, without coding.

### ‚ö° Does Bit Flows Slow Down Your Site?
No, even large or complex automation flows won't affect your site speed. Bit Flows is built to run tasks asynchronously, meaning everything happens in the background while your site remains fast and responsive. It uses an internal queue system to distribute tasks efficiently, preventing overloads during high-traffic or heavy-processing times. If your server resources are stretched, Bit Flows can temporarily pause tasks and automatically resume them when capacity becomes available. It's smart, efficient, and performance-conscious.

### üõí WooCommerce Automation
Bit Flows helps e-commerce businesses streamline their operations by automating order and customer workflows. When a new order is placed or a customer registers, Bit Flows can instantly send that data to platforms like Google Sheets, CRMs such as HubSpot or Salesforce, or email marketing tools. This eliminates repetitive work and ensures your data is always where it needs to be‚Äîaccurate and up to date.

### üìä Google Sheets Integration
Tracking and reporting business data becomes effortless with Bit Flows and Google Sheets. Whether it's a form submission, course enrollment, or WooCommerce order, the information is automatically logged in your Google Sheets. This gives you real-time visibility into your data without manual entry, making reporting faster and more reliable.

### üìá CRM Integration
Managing customer relationships is smoother with built-in CRM automation. Bit Flows integrates with leading CRMs like HubSpot, Salesforce, and Zoho. It can automatically add new leads, update customer records, and track interactions triggered by form submissions, purchases, or course activity. Your CRM stays current without manual syncing, helping you focus more on customer engagement and less on admin tasks.

### üìß Email Marketing Integration
Bit Flows connects directly to email platforms like MailChimp, Sendinblue, and ActiveCampaign. New subscribers, customers, or course participants are automatically added to your email lists. You can even segment contacts and trigger targeted email campaigns based on user activity‚Äîwithout lifting a finger. It's email automation made simple and efficient.

### üîÅ Webhook Automation
Whether you're sending data out or bringing it in, Bit Flows supports full webhook automation. Incoming webhooks let external platforms trigger workflows on your site, while outgoing webhooks push processed data to apps you use for marketing, reporting, or CRM. This enables powerful cross-platform workflows, especially in cases where native integrations don't exist.

### üéì LMS Integration (LearnDash, Tutor LMS)
For online learning platforms, Bit Flows automates essential LMS tasks. When a user enrolls, completes a lesson, or submits a quiz, Bit Flows can sync that data to your CRM, update a spreadsheet, or trigger follow-up emails. This improves course management, automates student tracking, and reduces the manual effort involved in running an LMS.
